    <h1>A5: High(er) Voltage and Transistors</h1>
    <div class="header">
      <p>For this assignment we were tasked with buidling a circuit containing a sensor, a transistor, and an 
        external power source.</p>

      <p> 
        This is an image of my final circuit built on a breadboard, connected to the Arduino, and connected to 
        an external power source. 
        The red and white LEDs are in parallel branches, and each have their own resistor,
        The white LED is conneced to pin 2. The red LED is connected to pin 3. The transistor is connnected to pin 9 
        and the IR sensor is connected to pin 7.

<h2> Additional Questions </h2>
<div class="image-text-wide">

  <h3> 1: These are the datasheets for the n-mosfet transistor: DMT6009LCT, IRLZ44N, P30N06LE. Read the text on
     your mosfet to see which one you have. For your mosfet, what is the absolute maximum amount of current between 
     pins 2 and 3?</h3> <br>
        
    <p> 
    Our transistor is the DMT6009LCT. Per the datasheet, the absolute maximum amount of current between 
    pins 2 and 3 (Source and Drain) or the continuous drain current is 37.2 A.

  <h3> 2: Draw a schematic for a circuit with using at least your arduino, a DC motor, a flyback diode, 
    and capacitors between power and ground. Find parts with datasheets you could use for each of these 
    schematic components.

  <h3>3: Here is the datasheet for the L293D chip: https://www.ti.com/product/L293D. 
    Draw a schematic using at least your arduino, this chip, and two motors. Write (pseudo) code that shows how 
    you would move the motors both forward, both back, then one forward one back, and one back then forward.
