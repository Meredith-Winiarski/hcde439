<h1>A5: High(er) Voltage and Transistors</h1>
  <div class="header">
    <p>For this assignment we were tasked with creating a circuit that included a sensor, a high-load output device,
    an external power source, and a transistor. I created a circuit that used an IR receiver to turn on and off 3 LEDs
    in series, that uses 9v of external power. When the IR sensor reads that the power button was pressed, it activates
    a transistor that controls the power to the LEDs.
    </p>

<p>

  This is an image of my final circuit built on a breadboard and connected to the Arduino and to the 9V external power supply.
  The 3 LEDs are in series with one resistor. They are connected, through the resistor, to the 9V power supply, and
  the transistor is connected to the ground of the power supply. The transistor is also connected to pin 10 of the Arduino.
  The IR receiver is connected to pin 7 of the Arduino, and the ground and 5V of the Arduino.

<h2> Circuit Diagram </h2>

<div class="image-text">
<img src="A5_Schematic.jpg" />

<p> Here is the schematic diagram for my circuit.
The IR receiver was its own branch connected to the Arduino.
The 3 red LEDs were in series with a resistor, and that branch was connected to the 9V power supply and the transistor.
The transistor was connected to the series of leds, to a digital pin, and to the ground of the power supply.

<h2> Choosing Resistors </h2>
<div class="image-text">
<img src="A5_Calculations.jpg" />
<p>
To choose the right resistors for each branch, I started by measuring the voltage drop through
each LED. The red LEDs have a drop of approximately 2 volts each (6 volts total). The external source provided 9 volts
and I wanted a current of 20 mA. Then I used Ohm's Law (V = IR) to calculate the resistance
needed. The result was a 150 ohm resistor. To ensure that my the current would be 20mA or lower, I rounded up to the closest
resistor value in our kit which is a 220 ohm resistor.

<h2> Final Circuit GIF </h2>
<div class="image-text">
<img src="A5_GIF.gif" />

<p>Here is a GIF of the final circuit. When the power button on the remote is pressed, the IR sensor detects
the signal and changes the system value from either on to off. If the system is on, the transistor is turned on,
which allows power to flow to the LEDs, turning them on. If the system is off, the transistor is turned off, which
stops power from flowing to the LEDs, keeping them off.

<h2> Additional Questions </h2>
<div class="image-text-wide">

  <h3> 1: These are the datasheets for the n-mosfet transistor: DMT6009LCTL, IRLZ44NL, P30N06LE. Read the text on your mosfet to see
     which one you have. For your mosfet, what is the absolute maximum amount of current between pins 2 and 3?</h3>

     <p> The mosfet I used is the IRLZ44NL. According to its datasheet, the absolute maximum current between pins 2 and 3 is 47A</p>
  </div>

  <div class="image-text-wide">

  <h3> 2: Draw a schematic for a circuit with using at least your arduino, a DC motor, a flyback diode, and capacitors between power
     and ground. Find parts with datasheets you could use for each of these schematic components. </h3>

     <p> 

     </p>


     <div class="image-text-wide">

  <h3>33: Here is the datasheet for the L293D chip: https://www.ti.com/product/L293DLinks. Draw a schematic using at least your 
    arduino, this chip, and two motors. Write (pseudo) code that shows how you would move the motors both forward, both back, then 
    one forward one back, and one back then forward.
