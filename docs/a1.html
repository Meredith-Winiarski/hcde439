    <h1>A1: Blink!</h1>
    <p> 
      For this assignment, we were tasked with creating a circuit containing 3+ 
        LEDs where each LED blinks independently. 
      
         I chose to create a circuit with a blue, green, and white LED that blink to spell out 
         "Go Hawks!" in Morse code. 

    </p>

      <p> 
        This is an image of my final circuit built on a breadboard and connected to the Arduino. 
        The blue, green, and white LEDs are in parallel branches, and each have their own resistor,
        They are connected to digital pins 7, 8, and 9.

    <h2> Circuit Diagram </h2>
    <div class="image-text">
      <img src="A1_Schematic.jpg" />

      <p> Here is the schematic diagram for my circuit. Since I was using three different colored LEDs, I 
        created a parallel circuit with three branches. Each branch contains one LED and one resistor. 
        By using a parallel circuit, I ensured voltage could split and was constant across each LED. 
        This also allowed me to control each LED independently.

    <h2> Choosing Resistors </h2>
    <div class="image-text-wide">
      <img src="A1_Resistor_Math.jpg" />

      <p> 
        To choose the right resistors for each branch, I started by measuring the voltage drop through each LED.
        Each LED had a voltage drop between 2.8 and 3.0 volts, so I rounded up to 3.0 volts for each LED.
        I knew the arduino provided 5 volts of power and I wanted a current of 20 mA.
        Then I used Ohm's Law (V = IR) to calculate the resistance needed. The result was a 100 ohm resistor for each branch.
        However, since there is no 100 ohm resirotr in the circuit kit, I rounded up, using a 220 ohm resistor.

  <h2> Final Circuit GIF </h2>
    <div class="image-text-gif">
          <img src="A1_Blink.gif" />

          <p>Here is a GIF of the final circuit. Every blink of any color LED represents
           a dot or dash in Morse code.

<h2> Additional Questions </h2>

<h3> 1.  Voltage vs. Time Graph </h3>
        <div class="image-text-wide">
          <img src="Voltage_v_time.jpg" />
          <p> This graph shows voltage vs. time for each of the LEDs in the circuit.
            As shown, each LED turns on and off at a different time. The 0.25 seconds where an LED is on
            represents a dot in Morse code, while the 0.75 second represents a dash. 
            The gaps where none of the lights are on represent spaces between letters and words. <br>
          </p>
          
        </div>

        <h3> 2. Maximum number of LEDs</h3>
        <p>
          You should be able to independently blink 13 LEDs using an Arduino because the Arduino has 13
          digital pins. To blink an LED indepdently it needs to be connected to its own digital pin, thus 
          making the total 13 LEDs. Assumung we are drawing the ideal amount of current, 20mA per pin,
          we will be drawing 260mA if all 13 LEDs are on at the same time. 
        </p>

        <h3> 3. Speed of LEDs </h3>

        <p>
          At delay(10) or 0.010 seconds, you can no longer tell the LED is blinking. At around 0.02 seconds, 
          the LED begins to look like it was vibrating or buzzing rather than blinking, but at 0.01 seconds, 
          it loses this appearance and appears to be constantly on. 
        </p>

        <h3> 4. AI Use </h3>  
        <p>
           I did not use AI when completing this assignment.
